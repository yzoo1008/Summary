# Anomaly
  
## Gas Interference
- In high GOR wells.
- Gas enters the pump and reduces the volumetric efficiency.
- Due to the gas, TV and SV are opens late.
- Gas expansion at upstroke, gas compression in the down stroke.
- Gas and oil is not seperated -> During the down storke, load decrease smoothly.

## Fluid pound
- Caused by a mismatch between the pump displacement rate and the production rate of liquid from the reservoir.
- This over-pumping may cause mechanical damage to the pump of increased buckling and wear.
- Gas and oil is seperated -> During the down storke, load derease rapidly as soon as the plunger meets fluid.

## Leaking of the TV
- Very common problem
- Card shape is the rounded top half of the cant.
- Maximum fluid load on the plunger occurs approximately in the middle of the stroke where the plunger has maximum speed.

## Leaking of the SV
- Beginning and the end of the downstorke changes found at the dynamometer card. Otherwise, there is no difference.
- The pressure in the pump barrel cannot invrease fast enough.
- Minimum fluid load on the plunger occurs approximately in the middle of the stroke where the plunger has maximum speed.

## Gas Lock
- Similar to gas interference.
- This problem can be solved either by increasing pump clearance or by increasing the dipping of the pumps inside the well.

# Plunger Hitting Bottom and Top
- Change at the end of the downstroke or the end of the upstroke is occured.

# Malfunctioning Tubing Anchor
